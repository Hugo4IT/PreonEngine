# PreonData

A piece of code left over from translating my mysterious C project to Rust but never used because Rust just offered everything I needed.

It contains a big amount of functions to serialize and deserialize all types listed below into bytes:

- `i8   / i16 / i32 / i64 / i128`
- `u8   / u16 / u32 / u64 / u128`
- `f32  / f64`
- `bool / [bool; 8]`

The full mysterious project will be released soon under the MIT license
